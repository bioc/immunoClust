immunoClust 1.13.2
    CHANGES
     * minor bugfixes and code cleaning

immunoClust 1.9.3
   CHANGES
    * acccedentially change in cell-clustering corrected
    * minor changes in plot and splom methods

immunoClust 1.9.2
   CHANGES
    * Optional label parameter in meta-clustering to continue the 
    meta-clustering with an initial cluster to meta-cluster assignment

immunoClust 1.9.1
   CHANGES
    * Minor improvements and additional option in plot and splom methods
    * Introduce of ALPHA option also for normalization precedures
    
immunoClust 1.3.3
    CHANGES
    * Optional plotting of additional parameter in FCS files
    * Minor changes in export meta-cluster features
    BUGFIXES
    * Problems with clustering of 1-D data sets

immunoClust 1.3.1
    CHANGES
    * The normalization step within the meta.clusering proces is improved
      and extended which also effects the related  parameter settings

immunoClust 1.1.1.
    NEW FEATRUES:
    * A normalization step which the sample cell-clusters to the common
      meta-cluster model is included an optionally activated during the
      major meta-clustering process.

    CHANGES:
    * The meta.ME C-binding and return value was modified in a way that the
      A-Posterior probability matrix Z for a cell-cluster belonging to a
      meta-cluster is also calculated and returned.
    BUFIXES:
    * Ellipse position were not correct when ploting a parameter subset

immunoClust 1.0.0:
    The first version caintains basically the functios and routines usesd to 
    obtain the results of 
    "Soerensen, T., Baumgart, S., Durek, P., Gruetzkau, A. and Haeupl, T. 
    immunoClust - an automated analysis pipeline for the identification of 
    immunophenotypic signatures in high-dimensional cytometric datasets. 
    Cytometry A (accepted)."

    CHANGES:
    * The code was cleaned and modified in the C-binding calls to make
      it runable on R 3.1.2.
    * A bug in the cell.hclust function was fixed, which does not effect
      the general results but lead to minor differences in concrete
      numbers.

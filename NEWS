Changes in version 1.19.4
- CHANGES
  * code cleaning

Changes in version 1.19.3
- CHANGES
  * fixes a compiler error under windows
  
Changes in version 1.19.1
- CHANGES
  * bugfix in transformParam.immunoMeta

Changes in version 1.17.4
- CHANGES
  * bugfix in subset.immunoMeta ans subset.immunoClust

Changes in version 1.17.3
- CHANGES
  * bugfix in subset.immunoMeta

Changes in version 1.17.2
- NEW FEATURES
  * introducing immunoMeta-class on meta-clustering results to buildup and
    annotate a hierachical population/sub-populaton tree
- CHANGES
  * trail of automated annotation of meta-clusters using scatter-clustering is
    removed. The approach does not work in a usefull manner. Instead the
    immunoMeta-class is introduced providing methods for a manual annotation
    of meta-cluster. See man-pages and vignette for more details.
  * set.seed is removed from clustering routines. To obtain reproducable
    results with cell.process function set.seed has to set explicit before.

Changes in version 1.17.1
- CHANGES
  * minor bugfixes and code cleaning
  * minor additional options for immunoClust.plot/splom

Changes in version 1.15.1
- NEW FEATRUES
  * additional cell-clustering method which is more reliable for samples
    with cutted edge values (e.g. CyTOF or logarithmic applified and digitized)
- CHANGES
  * bufix in the final ICL calculation for meta-clustering
  * minor change in cluster re-labeling within sub-clustering routine which
    leads finally to differences in cluster numbering

Changes in version 1.13.3
- NEW FEATRUES
  * additional variant of t-mixture model fitting respecting truncated
    observed values
- CHANGES
  * minor bugfixes and code cleaning

Changes in version 1.9.3
 - CHANGES
  * acccedentially change in cell-clustering corrected
  * minor changes in plot and splom methods

Changes in version 1.9.2
 - CHANGES
  * Optional label parameter in meta-clustering to continue the
    meta-clustering with an initial cluster to meta-cluster assignment

Changes in version 1.9.1
 - CHANGES
  * Minor improvements and additional option in plot and splom methods
  * Introduce of ALPHA option also for normalization precedures
    
Changes in version 1.3.3
 - CHANGES
  * Optional plotting of additional parameter in FCS files
  * Minor changes in export meta-cluster features
 - BUGFIXES
  * Problems with clustering of 1-D data sets

Changes in version 1.3.1
 - CHANGES
  * The normalization step within the meta.clusering proces is improved
      and extended which also effects the related  parameter settings

Changes in version 1.1.1.
 - NEW FEATRUES
  * A normalization step which the sample cell-clusters to the common
      meta-cluster model is included an optionally activated during the
      major meta-clustering process.

 - CHANGES
  * The meta.ME C-binding and return value was modified in a way that the
      A-Posterior probability matrix Z for a cell-cluster belonging to a
      meta-cluster is also calculated and returned.
 - BUFIXES
  * Ellipse position were not correct when ploting a parameter subset

Changes in version 1.0.0:
 - CHANGES
  * The code was cleaned and modified in the C-binding calls to make
      it runable on R 3.1.2.
  * A bug in the cell.hclust function was fixed, which does not effect
      the general results but lead to minor differences in concrete
      numbers.

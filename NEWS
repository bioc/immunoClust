Changes in version 1.3.3
 - CHANGES
  * Optional plotting of additional parameter in FCS files

Changes in version 1.3.1
 - CHANGES
  * The normalization step within the meta.clusering proces is improved
      and extended which also effects the related  parameter settings

Changes in version 1.1.1.
 - NEW FEATRUES
  * A normalization step which the sample cell-clusters to the common
      meta-cluster model is included an optionally activated during the
      major meta-clustering process.

 - CHANGES
  * The meta.ME C-binding and return value was modified in a way that the
      A-Posterior probability matrix Z for a cell-cluster belonging to a
      meta-cluster is also calculated and returned.
 - BUFIXES
  * Ellipse position were not correct when ploting a parameter subset

Changes in version 1.0.0:
 - CHANGES
  * The code was cleaned and modified in the C-binding calls to make
      it runable on R 3.1.2.
  * A bug in the cell.hclust function was fixed, which does not effect
      the general results but lead to minor differences in concrete
      numbers.

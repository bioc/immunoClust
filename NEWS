  * introducing immunoMeta-class on meta-clustering results to buildup and
    annotate a hierarchical population/sub-populaton tree

      and extended which also effects the related  parameter settings

      meta-cluster model is included an optionally activated during the

      it runnable on R 3.1.2.
  * A bug in the cell.hclust function was fixed, which does not effect
      the general results but lead to minor differences in concrete
      numbers.
